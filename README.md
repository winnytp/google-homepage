# The winGoogle Project
Howdy there, random person!

I'm following these directions from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css

## Aim
The aim is to build a replica Google homepage layout using HTML and CSS, *but* there's no functionality. So really, it's a simple project.

I'm starting with a blank canvas. Whatever you see is stuff I've manually typed and coded.

## To-do
Here's some stuff still to do:
- Investigate CSS grid layout to complete navbar layout look
- Make the search box have rounded corners, and add the search icon
- Add the entire footer section
