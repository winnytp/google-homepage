# The winGoogle Project
Howdy there, random person! This is my attempt at replicating the Google homepage without looking at anyone else's source code or files (yet, anyway).

Since this is my first time coding HTML and CSS from scratch, there's bound to be weird issues. I'm already **certain** that I'm not following best practices. But there's only one way to learn, right?

I'm following these directions from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css

Will not move on until this is completed!

## Aim
The aim is to build a replica Google homepage layout using HTML and CSS, *but* there's no functionality. So really, it's an exercise in layout building.

I'm starting with a blank canvas. Whatever you see is stuff I've manually typed and coded.

## To-do
Here's some stuff still to do:
- Add the 'Voice Search' icon
- Investigate why HTML and body tags needed padding: 0 and margin: 0 to make their container widths fill screen without overflow.

# Issues
- I don't even know anymore

There's probably more issues I haven't thought about. Will add when I have the time.
