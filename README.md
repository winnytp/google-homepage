# Google Homepage Project
Howdy! 

I'm following these directions from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css

## Aim:
The aim is to build a replica Google homepage layout using HTML and CSS, *but* there's no functionality. So really, it's a simple project.

I'm starting with a blank canvas, so whatever you see is stuff I've typed myself.

Thanks!
