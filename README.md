# The winGoogle Project
Howdy there, random person! This is my attempt at replicating the Google homepage without looking at anyone else's source code or files (yet, anyway).

Since this is my first time coding HTML and CSS from scratch, there's bound to be weird issues. I'm already **certain** that I'm not following best practices. But there's only one way to learn, right?

I'm following these directions from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css

Will not move on until this is completed!

## Aim
The aim is to build a replica Google homepage layout using HTML and CSS, *but* there's no functionality. So really, it's a simple project.

I'm starting with a blank canvas. Whatever you see is stuff I've manually typed and coded.

## To-do
Here's some stuff still to do:
- Investigate CSS grid layout for navbar
- Make the search box have rounded corners, and add the search icon
- Add the entire footer section

# Issues
- Navbar is broken, layout needs investigation

There's probably more issues I haven't thought about. Will add when I have the time.
